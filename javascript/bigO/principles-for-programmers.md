PRINCIPLE 1

What’s NOT going to change in the next 10 years?

Build a strategy around the things that are stable in time. As a programmer, you will always have to solve problems. You will always have to effectively communicate with others, and you will always have to continue to learn and upgrade your skills. Focus a big chunk of your energy on skills that are virtually guaranteed to be valuable in the future, no matter what.

It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, "Jeff, I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher." "I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly." Impossible. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.

PRINCIPLE 2

Helping others without answers

Programmers don't grow by being given the answers. They grow by trying things, experimenting and solving problems themselves. These are the skills and lessons that will serve them well as they level up their career. Instead of giving them the answers, give them the tools to find the answers. Help others by letting them reach a conclusion or solution on their own. Just guide them in getting to that goal without holding their hand.

PRINCIPLE 3

Beware of the half-life

Everything we know, not just about programming, has an expiration. The half-life of knowledge is a term to denote the time it takes for half the knowledge in a domain to be outdated. According to one study, the half life of an engineer in 1930 was 35 years vs 10 years in 1960 . Imagine what it is now. Because technology is moving so fast, eventually the ability to solve problems, and continuously learn, will become the most sought after skill. This is a muscle that you can train.

PRINCIPLE 4

Experience is not created equal

10 years coding by yourself with no other programmers around you, with no code reviews, doesn’t necessarily make you better than someone who has 1 year of coding experience working on a project with team members and getting code reviews daily. Get out of your bubble. Work with others, be surrounded by other programmers and learn from them. The biggest thing you can do if you are starting out is to get hired as soon as possible so you can work with others to accelerate your learning. Let others see your work. Get feedback. That’s how you gain experience.

PRINCIPLE 5

Don’t follow the money, Follow the brains

Great pay and salary today is good. But if you want to succeed long term, you are better of taking a lower pay to be surrounded by smart people and being in a situation that allows you to learn from others. If you can get both, that is even better, but always have this as a priority when picking between options: Which option will allow me to learn and grow the most and be surrounded by people smarter than me?
